# Titanic_Classification
Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more.
This is a classification project using Python and the Titanic data set. The goal was to use different machine learning algorithms to predict which passengers survived and compare the results to determine which algorithm is best suited for this problem.
